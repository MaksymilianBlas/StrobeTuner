# StrobeTuner
Cool project inspired by Elektronika Praktyczna magazine.
PIC microcontroller generates PWM signal for a white LED with variable frequencies, corresponding to the fundamental frequencies of the strings on a bass / electric guitar. When the string is properly tuned, it movement can't be seen under the LED light, due to the stroboscopic effect. The tuner switches to the next frequency (next string) after a button is pressed, and indicates which string is being tuned by lighting up one of 6 yellow LEDs. Power comes from a coin cell battery.
PCB for this project has been etched at home and worked very well.
